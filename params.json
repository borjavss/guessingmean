Yo should to use the side bar in left region of the screen in order to **guess the mean expansion velocity** of the galaxies given in mentioned data.\r\n\r\n### How I know if I get good results?\r\nWell, you can use:\r\n\r\n- Data histogram (try to get the solution with only this graphic)\r\n- Given values of\r\n      - Difference between your value and real value\r\n      - RMSE root mean square error commited\r\n- Data set graphic information\r\n\r\n```{r graph}\r\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\r\nhist(galaxies, xlab='velocity (km/sec)', col='orange',\r\n     main='Histogram respresentation', cex.lab=1.1, cex.main=1.2)\r\nlines(c(mean(galaxies),mean(galaxies)), c(0, 46), col=\"green\",lwd=5)\r\nplot(galaxies, ylab='Velocity (km/sec)', xlab=\"Each one of the given galaxies in data set\",\r\n     col=\"orange\", pch=8, lwd=3, main='Data set representation', cex.lab=1.1, cex.main=1.2)\r\nlines(x=c(0,length(galaxies)),y=c(mean(galaxies),mean(galaxies)), col=\"green\",lwd=5)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![rplot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4093468/3714168/452c9650-1598-11e4-8495-5e09674d05fa.jpeg)\r\n\r\nNOTE: solution is represented by green line in each of previous graphs. During the game, your selected MU will be showed in red color.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Remember, you want to minimize RMSE value ;)\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\nIt's simple. You enter a value through slider bar, this will be your MU value (NOTE: MU is your try mean value).\r\nThen, app plot your given value in the histrogram giving you:\r\n\r\n- DIFFERENCE: The difference between your value (MU) and the real value (the solution)\r\n- RMSE: The RMSE root mean square error comminted in your MU selection.\r\n\r\n#### How app calculate this values?\r\n\r\n- Difference is calculated by: $DIFFERENCE = MU - mean(galaxies)$\r\n- RMSE is calculated by: $RMSE = sqrt(mean((galaxies - mu)^2))$\r\n\r\n> Do not worry about calculation, just try it!!! :D\r\n\r\n### What is the goal of the game?\r\n\r\nYou should to reduce DIFFERENCE and RMSE. So, best value in both cases will be 0.\r\n\r\n -It is really hard to get it with the slide bar :D\r\n\r\n> That's the game ;) :D\r\n\r\n### I hope you enjoy it!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
